Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down, and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became a Software Engineer.

In China born and California raised, around the world is where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out, learnin', explorin' all cool, and startin' some businesses after grad school.

When a couple of folks who were up to all good, started talkin' Tech in my neighborhood. I got in one little bootcamp and it changed my life. Fate said, "You're joining Heroku Web Services for the next three years!"

I longed for a change, and when it came near, the project sounded fresh and it had good vibes in the air. If anything I could say that this job was rare, and I thought "Yeah let's get it. Yo, home to HashiCorp!"
