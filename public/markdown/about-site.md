# About This Site

This site draws inspiration from these portfolios [[1]](https://github.com/vivek9patel/vivek9patel.github.io), [[2]](https://github.com/L0SER8228/terminal-portfolio), [[3]](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos).

The design is inspired by macOS [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/big-sur/) and [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/bw/macos/catalina/), developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Some of the icons are generated using [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli).

The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/xiaolin-ninja/portfolio).
